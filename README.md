# Phototaxis
Calcium-imaging and phototaxis processing scripts used to characterize photoresponses in Platynereis larvae

The Ca-imaging script, calculates dF/F. Before running one has to set the home, the name of the neuron (for later identification plus data will be saved with this name), the fps (timerate) which can be found in the input filename and based on this and firing activity you have to choose the amount of frames the script will average and calculate the minimum from to get Fo. The second part of the script plots original and calculated data, and you have the option to plot different dF/Fs in one plot too. Make sure you edit the plot labels accordingly.

The phototaxis scoring scripts use ImageJ and perl.
